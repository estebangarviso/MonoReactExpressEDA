# Common Libraries

This directory contains common libraries that are used across multiple projects.

# Building

To build the common libraries, run the build turbo script in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
pnpm -F @demo/common run build
# or
pnpm run build:<environment>
```

If you are modifying the common libraries, you can run the build script in watch mode:

```bash
pnpm -F @demo/common run build:watch
```
